Kripke-puzzle
=============

This is an example of a fifteen piece puzzle with animation on the pieces, a counter for the moves one made and the time elapsed, and a "win" background image.
There are some browser compatibility problems that need to be worked on in the next edition: The puzzle only works on Chrome and Samsung GS4. For more compatibility the different way of calculating sizes on the screen crossbrowsers needs to be compensated for.
